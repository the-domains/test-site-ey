    description: "Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how \"power posing\" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even have an impact on our chances for success."
